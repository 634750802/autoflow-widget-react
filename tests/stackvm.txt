It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\n\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\n\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\n\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\n\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\n\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution."},{"name":"Business Applications","description":"Applications that use the TiDB cluster as their database."},{"name":"TiDB FAQs","description":"Frequently asked questions about TiDB.

Communication between components is secured via TLS encryption, and data restoration can be performed using full backups combined with binlog backups through the Reparo tool. Monitoring and diagnostics are facilitated by tools like Grafana + Prometheus and commands such as 'tiup diag collect ${cluster-name}'. The cluster supports high availability, strong consistency, horizontal scalability, and bidirectional replication via TiCDC.

Traditional solutions are costly and inefficient, with low resource utilization and high maintenance costs. TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to schedule data to different data centers, racks, and machines, ensuring system RTO \u2266 30 seconds and RPO = 0.\n\n- **Massive data and high concurrency scenarios**\n\n    Traditional standalone databases cannot meet the data capacity requirements of rapidly growing applications. TiDB is a cost-effective solution that adopts a separate computing and storage architecture, enabling easy scaling of computing or storage capacity separately. The computing layer supports a maximum of 512 nodes, each node supports a maximum of 1,000 concurrencies, and the maximum cluster capacity is at the PB (petabytes) level.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for scenarios with massive data and high concurrency that require real-time processing. TiDB introduces the TiFlash columnar storage engine in v4.0, which combines with the TiKV row-based storage engine to build TiDB as a true HTAP database. With a small amount of extra storage cost, you can handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis in the same system, which greatly saves cost.\n\n- **Data aggregation and secondary processing scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is suitable for companies that need to aggregate scattered data into the same system and execute secondary processing to generate a T+0 or T+1 report. Compared with Hadoop, TiDB is much simpler. You can replicate data into TiDB using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or data migration tools provided by TiDB. Reports can be directly generated using SQL statements.\n\n## See also\n\n- [TiDB Architecture](/tidb-architecture.md)\n- [TiDB Storage](/tidb-storage.md)\n- [TiDB Computing](/tidb-computing.md)\n- [TiDB Scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md)","document_id":15694,"meta":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview","tidb_version":"v8.1"}},{"id":"47c0551d-8238-4ba6-a462-ac0b32fb9648","text":"---\ntitle: TiDB 2.1.4 Release Notes\nsummary: TiDB 2.1.4 and TiDB Ansible 2.1.4 were released on February 15, 2019.

It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\nTiDB Self-Managed is a product option of TiDB, where users or organizations can deploy and manage TiDB on their own infrastructure with complete flexibility. With TiDB Self-Managed, you can enjoy the power of open source, distributed SQL while retaining full control over your environment.\n\nThe following video introduces key features of TiDB.\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWBNNPm21zg?enablejsapi=1\" title=\"Why TiDB?\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Key features\n\n- **Easy horizontal scaling**\n\n    The TiDB architecture design separates computing from storage, letting you scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed. The scaling process is transparent to application operations and maintenance staff.\n\n- **Financial-grade high availability**\n\n    Data is stored in multiple replicas, and the Multi-Raft protocol is used to obtain the transaction log. A transaction can only be committed when data has been successfully written into the majority of replicas. This guarantees strong consistency and availability when a minority of replicas go down. You can configure the geographic location and number of replicas as needed to meet different disaster tolerance levels.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP**\n\n    TiDB provides two storage engines: [TiKV](/tikv-overview.md), a row-based storage engine, and [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md), a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. TiKV and TiFlash can be deployed on different machines as needed to solve the problem of HTAP resource isolation.\n\n- **Cloud-native distributed database**\n\n    TiDB is a distributed database designed for the cloud, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on the cloud platform. Users can elastically scale TiDB to meet the requirements of their changing workloads. In TiDB, each piece of data has at least 3 replicas, which can be scheduled in different cloud availability zones to tolerate the outage of a whole data center. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes and automates tasks related to operating the TiDB cluster, making TiDB easier to deploy on any cloud that provides managed Kubernetes. [TiDB Cloud](https://pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/), the fully-managed TiDB service, is the easiest, most economical, and most resilient way to unlock the full power of [TiDB in the cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/), allowing you to deploy and run TiDB clusters with just a few clicks.\n\n- **Compatible with the MySQL protocol and MySQL ecosystem**\n\n    TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol, common features of MySQL, and the MySQL ecosystem. To migrate applications to TiDB, you do not need to change a single line of code in many cases, or only need to modify a small amount of code. In addition, TiDB provides a series of [data migration tools](/ecosystem-tool-user-guide.md) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":0,"end_char_idx":4248,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.7078454256650992,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"},{"node":{"id_":"bdce455e-fd31-44c5-b88f-dde6f37a2843","embedding":null,"extra_info":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"What is TiDB Self-Managed","Header_2":"Use cases","Header_Level":2,"document_id":90233},"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"relationships":{"1":{"node_id":"90233","node_type":"4","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4"},"hash":"95fff71c20422ccc89cf5e45453904504846bb446a4cf28cae21a867f80a33d4","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"},"2":{"node_id":"c885e265-8441-47e8-8f00-fc8ee1e44015","node_type":"1","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"What is TiDB Self-Managed","Header_2":"Key features","Header_Level":2},"hash":"6a640ffc3839bcc30ee689cc6d85a690f28d1cc2501c5fe4104f9fc427fbfc53","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"}},"metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","metadata_seperator":"\n","text":"# What is TiDB Self-Managed\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Financial industry scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for financial industry scenarios with high requirements for data consistency, reliability, availability, scalability, and disaster tolerance. Traditional solutions are costly and inefficient, with low resource utilization and high maintenance costs. TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to schedule data to different data centers, racks, and machines, ensuring system RTO \u2266 30 seconds and RPO = 0.\n\n- **Massive data and high concurrency scenarios**\n\n    Traditional standalone databases cannot meet the data capacity requirements of rapidly growing applications. TiDB is a cost-effective solution that adopts a separate computing and storage architecture, enabling easy scaling of computing or storage capacity separately. The computing layer supports a maximum of 512 nodes, each node supports a maximum of 1,000 concurrencies, and the maximum cluster capacity is at the PB (petabytes) level.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for scenarios with massive data and high concurrency that require real-time processing. TiDB introduces the TiFlash columnar storage engine in v4.0, which combines with the TiKV row-based storage engine to build TiDB as a true HTAP database. With a small amount of extra storage cost, you can handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis in the same system, which greatly saves cost.\n\n- **Data aggregation and secondary processing scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is suitable for companies that need to aggregate scattered data into the same system and execute secondary processing to generate a T+0 or T+1 report. Compared with Hadoop, TiDB is much simpler. You can replicate data into TiDB using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or data migration tools provided by TiDB. Reports can be directly generated using SQL statements.\n\n## See also\n\n- [TiDB Architecture](/tidb-architecture.md)\n- [TiDB Storage](/tidb-storage.md)\n- [TiDB Computing](/tidb-computing.md)\n- [TiDB Scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md)","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":null,"end_char_idx":null,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.7052591932437893,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"},{"node":{"id_":"d3851089-63b2-45ad-9609-9d58da806157","embedding":null,"extra_info":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"TiDB Architecture FAQs","Header_2":"TiDB introduction and architecture","Header_3":"What is TiDB?","Header_Level":3,"document_id":90881},"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"relationships":{"1":{"node_id":"90881","node_type":"4","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4"},"hash":"b992da9b3439224e213961cdf40540e04822aa18b36be7fe1c0bb473db123c91","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"},"3":{"node_id":"da0fa415-b3c9-49bd-9eee-8873b6aaf7d5","node_type":"1","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"TiDB Architecture FAQs","Header_2":"TiDB introduction and architecture","Header_3":"How could TiDB support high concurrent `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations to the columnar storage engine (TiFlash) without hurting performance?","Header_Level":3},"hash":"14a72b37719b61450524b4e82872cc2b0ce8b4876987a5006df0a7a1b4d80455","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"}},"metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","metadata_seperator":"\n","text":"---\ntitle: TiDB Architecture FAQs\nsummary: Learn about the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) relating to TiDB.\n---\n\n# TiDB Architecture FAQs\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->\n\nThis document lists the Most Frequently Asked Questions about TiDB.\n\n## TiDB introduction and architecture\n\n### What is TiDB?\n\n<!-- Localization note for TiDB:\n\n- English: use distributed SQL, and start to emphasize HTAP\n- Chinese: can keep \"NewSQL\" and emphasize one-stop real-time HTAP (\"\u4e00\u6808\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6 HTAP\")\n- Japanese: use NewSQL because it is well-recognized\n\n-->\n\n[TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\n### What is TiDB's architecture?\n\nThe TiDB cluster has three components: the TiDB server, the PD (Placement Driver) server, and the TiKV server. For more details, see [TiDB architecture](/tidb-architecture.md), [TiDB storage](/tidb-storage.md), [TiDB computing](/tidb-computing.md), and [TiDB scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md).\n\n### Is TiDB based on MySQL?\n\nNo. TiDB supports MySQL syntax and protocol, but it is a new open source database that is developed and maintained by PingCAP, Inc.\n\n### What is the respective responsibility of TiDB, TiKV and PD (Placement Driver)?\n\n- TiDB works as the SQL computing layer, mainly responsible for parsing SQL, specifying query plan, and generating executor.\n- TiKV works as a distributed Key-Value storage engine, used to store the real data. In short, TiKV is the storage engine of TiDB.\n- PD works as the cluster manager of TiDB, which manages TiKV metadata, allocates timestamps, and makes decisions for data placement and load balancing.\n\n### Is it easy to use TiDB?\n\nYes, it is. When all the required services are started, you can use TiDB as easily as a MySQL server. You can replace MySQL with TiDB to power your applications without changing a single line of code in most cases. You can also manage TiDB using the popular MySQL management tools.\n\n### How is TiDB compatible with MySQL?\n\nCurrently, TiDB supports the majority of MySQL 8.0 syntax, but does not support triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. For more details, see [Compatibility with MySQL](/mysql-compatibility.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support distributed transactions?\n\nYes. TiDB distributes transactions across your cluster, whether it is a few nodes in a single location or many [nodes across multiple data centers](/multi-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment.md).\n\nInspired by Google's Percolator, the transaction model in TiDB is mainly a two-phase commit protocol with some practical optimizations. This model relies on a timestamp allocator to assign the monotone increasing timestamp for each transaction, so conflicts can be detected. [PD](/tidb-architecture.md#placement-driver-pd-server) works as the timestamp allocator in a TiDB cluster.\n\n### What programming language can I use to work with TiDB?\n\nAny language supported by MySQL client or driver.\n\n### Can I use other Key-Value storage engines with TiDB?\n\nYes. In addition to TiKV, TiDB supports standalone storage engines such as UniStore and MockTiKV. Note that in later TiDB releases, MockTiKV might NO LONGER be supported.\n\nTo check all TiDB-supported storage engines, use the following command:\n\n\n```shell\n./bin/tidb-server -h\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```shell\nUsage of ./bin/tidb-server:\n  -L string\n        log level: info, debug, warn, error, fatal (default \"info\")\n  -P string\n        tidb server port (default \"4000\")\n  -V    print version information and exit (default false)\n.........\n  -store string\n        registered store name, [tikv, mocktikv, unistore] (default \"unistore\")\n  ......\n```\n\n### In addition to the TiDB documentation, are there any other ways to acquire TiDB knowledge?\n\n- [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/): the most important and timely way to get TiDB related knowledge.\n- [TiDB blogs](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/): learn technical articles, product insights, and case studies.\n- [PingCAP Education](https://www.pingcap.com/education/?from=en): take online courses and certification programs.\n\n### What is the length limit for the TiDB user name?\n\n32 characters at most.\n\n### What are the limits on the number of columns and row size in TiDB?\n\n- The maximum number of columns in TiDB defaults to 1017. You can adjust the number up to 4096.\n- The maximum size of a single row defaults to 6 MB. You can increase the number up to 120 MB.\n\nFor more information, see [TiDB Limitations](/tidb-limitations.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support XA?\n\nNo. The JDBC driver of TiDB is MySQL Connector/J. When using Atomikos, set the data source to `type=\"com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource\"`. TiDB does not support the connection with MySQL JDBC XADataSource. MySQL JDBC XADataSource only works for MySQL (for example, using DML to modify the `redo` log).\n\nAfter you configure the two data sources of Atomikos, set the JDBC drives to XA. When Atomikos operates TM and RM (DB), Atomikos sends the command including XA to the JDBC layer. Taking MySQL for an example, when XA is enabled in the JDBC layer, JDBC will send a series of XA logic operations to InnoDB, including using DML to change the `redo` log. This is the operation of the two-phase commit. The current TiDB version does not support the upper application layer JTA/XA and does not parse XA operations sent by Atomikos.\n\nAs a standalone database, MySQL can only implement across-database transactions using XA; while TiDB supports distributed transactions using Google Percolator transaction model and its performance stability is higher than XA, so TiDB does not support JTA/XA and there is no need for TiDB to support XA.","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":0,"end_char_idx":6130,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.6881713123729986,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"}]}}

a:{"toolCallId":"4","result":{"tidb_features_knowledge_graph":{"entities":[{"name":"TiDB","description":"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\n\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\n\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\n\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\n\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\n\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution."},{"name":"TiDB Architecture","description":"The overall architecture of TiDB."},{"name":"TiDB Kernel","description":"The core database engine of TiDB."},{"name":"TiDB Architecture","description":"TiDB Architecture refers to the design and structural principles of the TiDB database system."},{"name":"Architecture of TiDB HTAP","description":"The underlying structure and components of the TiDB HTAP system."},{"name":"Performance","description":"Enhancements to the speed and efficiency of TiDB, including write performance and query processing."},{"name":"Improvements","description":"Improvements in TiDB 3.0.19 include performance enhancements and new features for TiDB, TiKV, and PD components."}],"relationships":[],"chunks":[]}}}

It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\nTiDB Self-Managed is a product option of TiDB, where users or organizations can deploy and manage TiDB on their own infrastructure with complete flexibility. With TiDB Self-Managed, you can enjoy the power of open source, distributed SQL while retaining full control over your environment.\n\nThe following video introduces key features of TiDB.\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWBNNPm21zg?enablejsapi=1\" title=\"Why TiDB?\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Key features\n\n- **Easy horizontal scaling**\n\n    The TiDB architecture design separates computing from storage, letting you scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed. The scaling process is transparent to application operations and maintenance staff.\n\n- **Financial-grade high availability**\n\n    Data is stored in multiple replicas, and the Multi-Raft protocol is used to obtain the transaction log. A transaction can only be committed when data has been successfully written into the majority of replicas. This guarantees strong consistency and availability when a minority of replicas go down. You can configure the geographic location and number of replicas as needed to meet different disaster tolerance levels.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP**\n\n    TiDB provides two storage engines: [TiKV](/tikv-overview.md), a row-based storage engine, and [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md), a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. TiKV and TiFlash can be deployed on different machines as needed to solve the problem of HTAP resource isolation.\n\n- **Cloud-native distributed database**\n\n    TiDB is a distributed database designed for the cloud, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on the cloud platform. Users can elastically scale TiDB to meet the requirements of their changing workloads. In TiDB, each piece of data has at least 3 replicas, which can be scheduled in different cloud availability zones to tolerate the outage of a whole data center. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes and automates tasks related to operating the TiDB cluster, making TiDB easier to deploy on any cloud that provides managed Kubernetes. [TiDB Cloud](https://pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/), the fully-managed TiDB service, is the easiest, most economical, and most resilient way to unlock the full power of [TiDB in the cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/), allowing you to deploy and run TiDB clusters with just a few clicks.\n\n- **Compatible with the MySQL protocol and MySQL ecosystem**\n\n    TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol, common features of MySQL, and the MySQL ecosystem. To migrate applications to TiDB, you do not need to change a single line of code in many cases, or only need to modify a small amount of code. In addition, TiDB provides a series of [data migration tools](/ecosystem-tool-user-guide.md) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":0,"end_char_idx":4248,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.7592546818419464,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"},{"node":{"id_":"bdce455e-fd31-44c5-b88f-dde6f37a2843","embedding":null,"extra_info":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"What is TiDB Self-Managed","Header_2":"Use cases","Header_Level":2,"document_id":90233},"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"relationships":{"1":{"node_id":"90233","node_type":"4","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4"},"hash":"95fff71c20422ccc89cf5e45453904504846bb446a4cf28cae21a867f80a33d4","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"},"2":{"node_id":"c885e265-8441-47e8-8f00-fc8ee1e44015","node_type":"1","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"What is TiDB Self-Managed","Header_2":"Key features","Header_Level":2},"hash":"6a640ffc3839bcc30ee689cc6d85a690f28d1cc2501c5fe4104f9fc427fbfc53","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"}},"metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","metadata_seperator":"\n","text":"# What is TiDB Self-Managed\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Financial industry scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for financial industry scenarios with high requirements for data consistency, reliability, availability, scalability, and disaster tolerance. Traditional solutions are costly and inefficient, with low resource utilization and high maintenance costs. TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to schedule data to different data centers, racks, and machines, ensuring system RTO \u2266 30 seconds and RPO = 0.\n\n- **Massive data and high concurrency scenarios**\n\n    Traditional standalone databases cannot meet the data capacity requirements of rapidly growing applications. TiDB is a cost-effective solution that adopts a separate computing and storage architecture, enabling easy scaling of computing or storage capacity separately. The computing layer supports a maximum of 512 nodes, each node supports a maximum of 1,000 concurrencies, and the maximum cluster capacity is at the PB (petabytes) level.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for scenarios with massive data and high concurrency that require real-time processing. TiDB introduces the TiFlash columnar storage engine in v4.0, which combines with the TiKV row-based storage engine to build TiDB as a true HTAP database. With a small amount of extra storage cost, you can handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis in the same system, which greatly saves cost.\n\n- **Data aggregation and secondary processing scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is suitable for companies that need to aggregate scattered data into the same system and execute secondary processing to generate a T+0 or T+1 report. Compared with Hadoop, TiDB is much simpler. You can replicate data into TiDB using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or data migration tools provided by TiDB. Reports can be directly generated using SQL statements.\n\n## See also\n\n- [TiDB Architecture](/tidb-architecture.md)\n- [TiDB Storage](/tidb-storage.md)\n- [TiDB Computing](/tidb-computing.md)\n- [TiDB Scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md)","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":null,"end_char_idx":null,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.7241279369783311,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"},{"node":{"id_":"d3851089-63b2-45ad-9609-9d58da806157","embedding":null,"extra_info":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"TiDB Architecture FAQs","Header_2":"TiDB introduction and architecture","Header_3":"What is TiDB?","Header_Level":3,"document_id":90881},"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"relationships":{"1":{"node_id":"90881","node_type":"4","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4"},"hash":"b992da9b3439224e213961cdf40540e04822aa18b36be7fe1c0bb473db123c91","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"},"3":{"node_id":"da0fa415-b3c9-49bd-9eee-8873b6aaf7d5","node_type":"1","metadata":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.4","Header_1":"TiDB Architecture FAQs","Header_2":"TiDB introduction and architecture","Header_3":"How could TiDB support high concurrent `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations to the columnar storage engine (TiFlash) without hurting performance?","Header_Level":3},"hash":"14a72b37719b61450524b4e82872cc2b0ce8b4876987a5006df0a7a1b4d80455","class_name":"RelatedNodeInfo"}},"metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","metadata_seperator":"\n","text":"---\ntitle: TiDB Architecture FAQs\nsummary: Learn about the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) relating to TiDB.\n---\n\n# TiDB Architecture FAQs\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->\n\nThis document lists the Most Frequently Asked Questions about TiDB.\n\n## TiDB introduction and architecture\n\n### What is TiDB?\n\n<!-- Localization note for TiDB:\n\n- English: use distributed SQL, and start to emphasize HTAP\n- Chinese: can keep \"NewSQL\" and emphasize one-stop real-time HTAP (\"\u4e00\u6808\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6 HTAP\")\n- Japanese: use NewSQL because it is well-recognized\n\n-->\n\n[TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\n### What is TiDB's architecture?\n\nThe TiDB cluster has three components: the TiDB server, the PD (Placement Driver) server, and the TiKV server. For more details, see [TiDB architecture](/tidb-architecture.md), [TiDB storage](/tidb-storage.md), [TiDB computing](/tidb-computing.md), and [TiDB scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md).\n\n### Is TiDB based on MySQL?\n\nNo. TiDB supports MySQL syntax and protocol, but it is a new open source database that is developed and maintained by PingCAP, Inc.\n\n### What is the respective responsibility of TiDB, TiKV and PD (Placement Driver)?\n\n- TiDB works as the SQL computing layer, mainly responsible for parsing SQL, specifying query plan, and generating executor.\n- TiKV works as a distributed Key-Value storage engine, used to store the real data. In short, TiKV is the storage engine of TiDB.\n- PD works as the cluster manager of TiDB, which manages TiKV metadata, allocates timestamps, and makes decisions for data placement and load balancing.\n\n### Is it easy to use TiDB?\n\nYes, it is. When all the required services are started, you can use TiDB as easily as a MySQL server. You can replace MySQL with TiDB to power your applications without changing a single line of code in most cases. You can also manage TiDB using the popular MySQL management tools.\n\n### How is TiDB compatible with MySQL?\n\nCurrently, TiDB supports the majority of MySQL 8.0 syntax, but does not support triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. For more details, see [Compatibility with MySQL](/mysql-compatibility.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support distributed transactions?\n\nYes. TiDB distributes transactions across your cluster, whether it is a few nodes in a single location or many [nodes across multiple data centers](/multi-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment.md).\n\nInspired by Google's Percolator, the transaction model in TiDB is mainly a two-phase commit protocol with some practical optimizations. This model relies on a timestamp allocator to assign the monotone increasing timestamp for each transaction, so conflicts can be detected. [PD](/tidb-architecture.md#placement-driver-pd-server) works as the timestamp allocator in a TiDB cluster.\n\n### What programming language can I use to work with TiDB?\n\nAny language supported by MySQL client or driver.\n\n### Can I use other Key-Value storage engines with TiDB?\n\nYes. In addition to TiKV, TiDB supports standalone storage engines such as UniStore and MockTiKV. Note that in later TiDB releases, MockTiKV might NO LONGER be supported.\n\nTo check all TiDB-supported storage engines, use the following command:\n\n\n```shell\n./bin/tidb-server -h\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```shell\nUsage of ./bin/tidb-server:\n  -L string\n        log level: info, debug, warn, error, fatal (default \"info\")\n  -P string\n        tidb server port (default \"4000\")\n  -V    print version information and exit (default false)\n.........\n  -store string\n        registered store name, [tikv, mocktikv, unistore] (default \"unistore\")\n  ......\n```\n\n### In addition to the TiDB documentation, are there any other ways to acquire TiDB knowledge?\n\n- [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/): the most important and timely way to get TiDB related knowledge.\n- [TiDB blogs](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/): learn technical articles, product insights, and case studies.\n- [PingCAP Education](https://www.pingcap.com/education/?from=en): take online courses and certification programs.\n\n### What is the length limit for the TiDB user name?\n\n32 characters at most.\n\n### What are the limits on the number of columns and row size in TiDB?\n\n- The maximum number of columns in TiDB defaults to 1017. You can adjust the number up to 4096.\n- The maximum size of a single row defaults to 6 MB. You can increase the number up to 120 MB.\n\nFor more information, see [TiDB Limitations](/tidb-limitations.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support XA?\n\nNo. The JDBC driver of TiDB is MySQL Connector/J. When using Atomikos, set the data source to `type=\"com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource\"`. TiDB does not support the connection with MySQL JDBC XADataSource. MySQL JDBC XADataSource only works for MySQL (for example, using DML to modify the `redo` log).\n\nAfter you configure the two data sources of Atomikos, set the JDBC drives to XA. When Atomikos operates TM and RM (DB), Atomikos sends the command including XA to the JDBC layer. Taking MySQL for an example, when XA is enabled in the JDBC layer, JDBC will send a series of XA logic operations to InnoDB, including using DML to change the `redo` log. This is the operation of the two-phase commit. The current TiDB version does not support the upper application layer JTA/XA and does not parse XA operations sent by Atomikos.\n\nAs a standalone database, MySQL can only implement across-database transactions using XA; while TiDB supports distributed transactions using Google Percolator transaction model and its performance stability is higher than XA, so TiDB does not support JTA/XA and there is no need for TiDB to support XA.","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":0,"end_char_idx":6130,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.7159332507749279,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"}]}}

a:{"toolCallId":"6","result":{"tidb_features_explanation":"TiDB is a robust, open-source distributed SQL database designed to support Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and offers several key features that make it suitable for a wide range of use cases, particularly those requiring high availability, strong consistency, and scalability with large-scale data.\n\n### Key Features of TiDB\n\n1. **Horizontal Scalability**: TiDB's architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. This means you can scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed, without disrupting application operations. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications experiencing rapid growth in data volume or user demand.\n\n2. **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: TiDB ensures data is stored in multiple replicas and uses the Multi-Raft protocol to manage transaction logs. A transaction is only committed when data is successfully written into the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability even if some replicas fail. This setup allows for configuration of geographic location and number of replicas to meet different disaster tolerance levels.\n\n3. **Real-time HTAP Capabilities**: TiDB integrates two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the two engines. This setup allows TiDB to handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis efficiently, making it a true HTAP database.\n\n4. **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, offering flexible scalability, reliability, and security. It supports elastic scaling to accommodate changing workloads and ensures data availability across different cloud zones. TiDB Operator facilitates management on Kubernetes, automating tasks related to operating the TiDB cluster, which simplifies deployment on any cloud platform that supports Kubernetes.\n\n5. **MySQL Compatibility**: TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol and ecosystem, allowing for seamless migration of applications with minimal code changes. It supports most MySQL features and provides data migration tools to facilitate easy data transfer into TiDB.\n\n6. **Financial-Grade Reliability**: TiDB is ideal for scenarios requiring high data consistency, reliability, and disaster tolerance, such as in the financial industry. It uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to ensure system recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) are met efficiently.\n\n7. **Support for Massive Data and High Concurrency**: TiDB's architecture supports massive data volumes and high concurrency, making it a cost-effective solution for applications that outgrow traditional standalone databases. It can handle up to 512 computing nodes, each supporting up to 1,000 concurrent operations, with a maximum cluster capacity at the petabyte level.\n\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's features and architecture, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview) and [TiDB Architecture FAQs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)."}}

a:{"toolCallId":"7","result":{"tidb_differences_knowledge_graph":{"entities":[{"name":"TiDB","description":"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\n\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\n\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\n\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\n\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\n\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution."},{"name":"Financial Industry Scenarios","description":"Use cases of TiDB in the financial industry where high requirements for data consistency, reliability, availability, scalability, and disaster tolerance are needed."},{"name":"Massive Data and High Concurrency Scenarios","description":"Use cases of TiDB in scenarios with massive data and high concurrency requirements."},{"name":"TiDB Cluster","description":"A distributed NewSQL database system designed for high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery.

It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\n### What is TiDB's architecture?\n\nThe TiDB cluster has three components: the TiDB server, the PD (Placement Driver) server, and the TiKV server. For more details, see [TiDB architecture](/tidb-architecture.md), [TiDB storage](/tidb-storage.md), [TiDB computing](/tidb-computing.md), and [TiDB scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md).\n\n### Is TiDB based on MySQL?\n\nNo. TiDB supports MySQL syntax and protocol, but it is a new open source database that is developed and maintained by PingCAP, Inc.\n\n### What is the respective responsibility of TiDB, TiKV and PD (Placement Driver)?\n\n- TiDB works as the SQL computing layer, mainly responsible for parsing SQL, specifying query plan, and generating executor.\n- TiKV works as a distributed Key-Value storage engine, used to store the real data. In short, TiKV is the storage engine of TiDB.\n- PD works as the cluster manager of TiDB, which manages TiKV metadata, allocates timestamps, and makes decisions for data placement and load balancing.\n\n### Is it easy to use TiDB?\n\nYes, it is. When all the required services are started, you can use TiDB as easily as a MySQL server. You can replace MySQL with TiDB to power your applications without changing a single line of code in most cases. You can also manage TiDB using the popular MySQL management tools.\n\n### How is TiDB compatible with MySQL?\n\nCurrently, TiDB supports the majority of MySQL 8.0 syntax, but does not support triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. For more details, see [Compatibility with MySQL](/mysql-compatibility.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support distributed transactions?\n\nYes. TiDB distributes transactions across your cluster, whether it is a few nodes in a single location or many [nodes across multiple data centers](/multi-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment.md).\n\nInspired by Google's Percolator, the transaction model in TiDB is mainly a two-phase commit protocol with some practical optimizations. This model relies on a timestamp allocator to assign the monotone increasing timestamp for each transaction, so conflicts can be detected. [PD](/tidb-architecture.md#placement-driver-pd-server) works as the timestamp allocator in a TiDB cluster.\n\n### What programming language can I use to work with TiDB?\n\nAny language supported by MySQL client or driver.\n\n### Can I use other Key-Value storage engines with TiDB?\n\nYes. In addition to TiKV, TiDB supports standalone storage engines such as UniStore and MockTiKV. Note that in later TiDB releases, MockTiKV might NO LONGER be supported.\n\nTo check all TiDB-supported storage engines, use the following command:\n\n\n```shell\n./bin/tidb-server -h\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```shell\nUsage of ./bin/tidb-server:\n  -L string\n        log level: info, debug, warn, error, fatal (default \"info\")\n  -P string\n        tidb server port (default \"4000\")\n  -V    print version information and exit (default false)\n.........\n  -store string\n        registered store name, [tikv, mocktikv, unistore] (default \"unistore\")\n  ......\n```\n\n### In addition to the TiDB documentation, are there any other ways to acquire TiDB knowledge?\n\n- [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/): the most important and timely way to get TiDB related knowledge.\n- [TiDB blogs](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/): learn technical articles, product insights, and case studies.\n- [PingCAP Education](https://www.pingcap.com/education/?from=en): take online courses and certification programs.\n\n### What is the length limit for the TiDB user name?\n\n32 characters at most.\n\n### What are the limits on the number of columns and row size in TiDB?\n\n- The maximum number of columns in TiDB defaults to 1017. You can adjust the number up to 4096.\n- The maximum size of a single row defaults to 6 MB. You can increase the number up to 120 MB.\n\nFor more information, see [TiDB Limitations](/tidb-limitations.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support XA?\n\nNo. The JDBC driver of TiDB is MySQL Connector/J. When using Atomikos, set the data source to `type=\"com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource\"`. TiDB does not support the connection with MySQL JDBC XADataSource. MySQL JDBC XADataSource only works for MySQL (for example, using DML to modify the `redo` log).\n\nAfter you configure the two data sources of Atomikos, set the JDBC drives to XA. When Atomikos operates TM and RM (DB), Atomikos sends the command including XA to the JDBC layer. Taking MySQL for an example, when XA is enabled in the JDBC layer, JDBC will send a series of XA logic operations to InnoDB, including using DML to change the `redo` log. This is the operation of the two-phase commit. The current TiDB version does not support the upper application layer JTA/XA and does not parse XA operations sent by Atomikos.\n\nAs a standalone database, MySQL can only implement across-database transactions using XA; while TiDB supports distributed transactions using Google Percolator transaction model and its performance stability is higher than XA, so TiDB does not support JTA/XA and there is no need for TiDB to support XA.","document_id":16356,"meta":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-faq","tidb_version":"v8.1"}},{"id":"ba5b48d8-05c4-4da7-8c69-2a98068be782","text":"---\ntitle: What is TiDB Self-Managed\nsummary: Learn about the key features and usage scenarios of TiDB.\n---\n\n# What is TiDB Self-Managed\n\n<!-- Localization note for TiDB:\n\n- English: use distributed SQL, and start to emphasize HTAP\n- Chinese: can keep \"NewSQL\" and emphasize one-stop real-time HTAP (\"\u4e00\u6808\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6 HTAP\")\n- Japanese: use NewSQL because it is well-recognized\n\n-->\n\n[TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) (/'ta\u026adi\u02d0bi:/, \"Ti\" stands for Titanium) is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads.

With TiDB Self-Managed, you can enjoy the power of open source, distributed SQL while retaining full control over your environment.\n\nThe following video introduces key features of TiDB.\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWBNNPm21zg?enablejsapi=1\" title=\"Why TiDB?\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Key features\n\n- **Easy horizontal scaling**\n\n    The TiDB architecture design separates computing from storage, letting you scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed. The scaling process is transparent to application operations and maintenance staff.\n\n- **Financial-grade high availability**\n\n    Data is stored in multiple replicas, and the Multi-Raft protocol is used to obtain the transaction log. A transaction can only be committed when data has been successfully written into the majority of replicas. This guarantees strong consistency and availability when a minority of replicas go down. You can configure the geographic location and number of replicas as needed to meet different disaster tolerance levels.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP**\n\n    TiDB provides two storage engines: [TiKV](/tikv-overview.md), a row-based storage engine, and [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md), a columnar storage engine. TiFlash uses the Multi-Raft Learner protocol to replicate data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the TiKV row-based storage engine and the TiFlash columnar storage engine. TiKV and TiFlash can be deployed on different machines as needed to solve the problem of HTAP resource isolation.\n\n- **Cloud-native distributed database**\n\n    TiDB is a distributed database designed for the cloud, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on the cloud platform. Users can elastically scale TiDB to meet the requirements of their changing workloads. In TiDB, each piece of data has at least 3 replicas, which can be scheduled in different cloud availability zones to tolerate the outage of a whole data center. [TiDB Operator](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview) helps manage TiDB on Kubernetes and automates tasks related to operating the TiDB cluster, making TiDB easier to deploy on any cloud that provides managed Kubernetes. [TiDB Cloud](https://pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/), the fully-managed TiDB service, is the easiest, most economical, and most resilient way to unlock the full power of [TiDB in the cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/), allowing you to deploy and run TiDB clusters with just a few clicks.\n\n- **Compatible with the MySQL protocol and MySQL ecosystem**\n\n    TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol, common features of MySQL, and the MySQL ecosystem. To migrate applications to TiDB, you do not need to change a single line of code in many cases, or only need to modify a small amount of code. In addition, TiDB provides a series of [data migration tools](/ecosystem-tool-user-guide.md) to help easily migrate application data into TiDB.","document_id":15694,"meta":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview","tidb_version":"v8.1"}},{"id":"6f142977-62be-4aef-8968-d48987515a58","text":"# What is TiDB Self-Managed\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Financial industry scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for financial industry scenarios with high requirements for data consistency, reliability, availability, scalability, and disaster tolerance. Traditional solutions are costly and inefficient, with low resource utilization and high maintenance costs. TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to schedule data to different data centers, racks, and machines, ensuring system RTO \u2266 30 seconds and RPO = 0.\n\n- **Massive data and high concurrency scenarios**\n\n    Traditional standalone databases cannot meet the data capacity requirements of rapidly growing applications. TiDB is a cost-effective solution that adopts a separate computing and storage architecture, enabling easy scaling of computing or storage capacity separately. The computing layer supports a maximum of 512 nodes, each node supports a maximum of 1,000 concurrencies, and the maximum cluster capacity is at the PB (petabytes) level.\n\n- **Real-time HTAP scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is ideal for scenarios with massive data and high concurrency that require real-time processing. TiDB introduces the TiFlash columnar storage engine in v4.0, which combines with the TiKV row-based storage engine to build TiDB as a true HTAP database. With a small amount of extra storage cost, you can handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis in the same system, which greatly saves cost.\n\n- **Data aggregation and secondary processing scenarios**\n\n    TiDB is suitable for companies that need to aggregate scattered data into the same system and execute secondary processing to generate a T+0 or T+1 report. Compared with Hadoop, TiDB is much simpler. You can replicate data into TiDB using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools or data migration tools provided by TiDB. Reports can be directly generated using SQL statements.\n\n## See also\n\n- [TiDB Architecture](/tidb-architecture.md)\n- [TiDB Storage](/tidb-storage.md)\n- [TiDB Computing](/tidb-computing.md)\n- [TiDB Scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md)","document_id":15694,"meta":{"language":"en","product":"tidb","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview","tidb_version":"v8.1"}},{"id":"f699dc59-736e-4100-8729-9019e4ef9dd3","text":"---\ntitle: TiDB Architecture\nsummary: The key architecture components of the TiDB platform\n---\n\n# TiDB Architecture\n\nCompared with the traditional standalone databases, TiDB has the following advantages:\n\n* Has a distributed architecture with flexible and elastic scalability.\n* Fully compatible with the MySQL protocol, common features and syntax of MySQL. To migrate your applications to TiDB, you do not need to change a single line of code in many cases.\n* Supports high availability with automatic failover when a minority of replicas fail; transparent to applications.\n* Supports ACID transactions, suitable for scenarios requiring strong consistency such as bank transfer.\n\n<CustomContent platform=\"tidb\">\n\n* Provides a rich series of [data migration tools](/migration-overview.md) for migrating, replicating, or backing up data.\n\n</CustomContent>\n\nAs a distributed database, TiDB is designed to consist of multiple components. These components communicate with each other and form a complete TiDB system. The architecture is as follows:\n\n![TiDB Architecture](https://download.pingcap.com/images/docs/tidb-architecture-v6.png)\n\n## TiDB server\n\nThe [TiDB server](/tidb-computing.md) is a stateless SQL layer that exposes the connection endpoint of the MySQL protocol to the outside. The TiDB server receives SQL requests, performs SQL parsing and optimization, and ultimately generates a distributed execution plan. It is horizontally scalable and provides the unified interface to the outside through the load balancing components such as Linux Virtual Server (LVS), HAProxy, or F5. It does not store data and is only for computing and SQL analyzing, transmitting actual data read request to TiKV nodes (or TiFlash nodes).\n\n## Placement Driver (PD) server\n\nThe [PD server](/tidb-scheduling.md) is the metadata managing component of the entire cluster. It stores metadata of real-time data distribution of every single TiKV node and the topology structure of the entire TiDB cluster, provides the TiDB Dashboard management UI, and allocates transaction IDs to distributed transactions. The PD server is \"the brain\" of the entire TiDB cluster because it not only stores metadata of the cluster, but also sends data scheduling command to specific TiKV nodes according to the data distribution state reported by TiKV nodes in real time. In addition, the PD server consists of three nodes at least and has high availability. It is recommended to deploy an odd number of PD nodes.\n\n## Storage servers\n\n### TiKV server\n\nThe [TiKV server](/tidb-storage.md) is responsible for storing data. TiKV is a distributed transactional key-value storage engine.\n\n<CustomContent platform=\"tidb\">\n\n[Region](/glossary.md#regionpeerraft-group) is the basic unit to store data. Each Region stores the data for a particular Key Range which is a left-closed and right-open interval from StartKey to EndKey.\n\n</CustomContent>\n\n<CustomContent platform=\"tidb-cloud\">\n\n[Region](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-glossary.md#region) is the basic unit to store data. Each Region stores the data for a particular Key Range which is a left-closed and right-open interval from StartKey to EndKey.\n\n</CustomContent>\n\nMultiple Regions exist in each TiKV node. TiKV APIs provide native support to distributed transactions at the key-value pair level and supports the Snapshot Isolation level isolation by default. This is the core of how TiDB supports distributed transactions at the SQL level. After processing SQL statements, the TiDB server converts the SQL execution plan to an actual call to the TiKV API. Therefore, data is stored in TiKV. All the data in TiKV is automatically maintained in multiple replicas (three replicas by default), so TiKV has native high availability and supports automatic failover.\n\n### TiFlash server\n\nThe [TiFlash server](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md) is a special type of storage server. Unlike ordinary TiKV nodes, TiFlash stores data by column, mainly designed to accelerate analytical processing.","document_id":30023,"meta":{"language":"en","product":"tidbcloud","resource":"docs","source_uri":"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-architecture","tidb_version":null}}]}}}

It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with a one-stop database solution that covers OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP services. TiDB is suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data.\n\n### What is TiDB's architecture?\n\nThe TiDB cluster has three components: the TiDB server, the PD (Placement Driver) server, and the TiKV server. For more details, see [TiDB architecture](/tidb-architecture.md), [TiDB storage](/tidb-storage.md), [TiDB computing](/tidb-computing.md), and [TiDB scheduling](/tidb-scheduling.md).\n\n### Is TiDB based on MySQL?\n\nNo. TiDB supports MySQL syntax and protocol, but it is a new open source database that is developed and maintained by PingCAP, Inc.\n\n### What is the respective responsibility of TiDB, TiKV and PD (Placement Driver)?\n\n- TiDB works as the SQL computing layer, mainly responsible for parsing SQL, specifying query plan, and generating executor.\n- TiKV works as a distributed Key-Value storage engine, used to store the real data. In short, TiKV is the storage engine of TiDB.\n- PD works as the cluster manager of TiDB, which manages TiKV metadata, allocates timestamps, and makes decisions for data placement and load balancing.\n\n### Is it easy to use TiDB?\n\nYes, it is. When all the required services are started, you can use TiDB as easily as a MySQL server. You can replace MySQL with TiDB to power your applications without changing a single line of code in most cases. You can also manage TiDB using the popular MySQL management tools.\n\n### How is TiDB compatible with MySQL?\n\nCurrently, TiDB supports the majority of MySQL 8.0 syntax, but does not support triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. For more details, see [Compatibility with MySQL](/mysql-compatibility.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support distributed transactions?\n\nYes. TiDB distributes transactions across your cluster, whether it is a few nodes in a single location or many [nodes across multiple data centers](/multi-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment.md).\n\nInspired by Google's Percolator, the transaction model in TiDB is mainly a two-phase commit protocol with some practical optimizations. This model relies on a timestamp allocator to assign the monotone increasing timestamp for each transaction, so conflicts can be detected. [PD](/tidb-architecture.md#placement-driver-pd-server) works as the timestamp allocator in a TiDB cluster.\n\n### What programming language can I use to work with TiDB?\n\nAny language supported by MySQL client or driver.\n\n### Can I use other Key-Value storage engines with TiDB?\n\nYes. In addition to TiKV, TiDB supports standalone storage engines such as UniStore and MockTiKV. Note that in later TiDB releases, MockTiKV might NO LONGER be supported.\n\nTo check all TiDB-supported storage engines, use the following command:\n\n\n```shell\n./bin/tidb-server -h\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```shell\nUsage of ./bin/tidb-server:\n  -L string\n        log level: info, debug, warn, error, fatal (default \"info\")\n  -P string\n        tidb server port (default \"4000\")\n  -V    print version information and exit (default false)\n.........\n  -store string\n        registered store name, [tikv, mocktikv, unistore] (default \"unistore\")\n  ......\n```\n\n### In addition to the TiDB documentation, are there any other ways to acquire TiDB knowledge?\n\n- [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/): the most important and timely way to get TiDB related knowledge.\n- [TiDB blogs](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/): learn technical articles, product insights, and case studies.\n- [PingCAP Education](https://www.pingcap.com/education/?from=en): take online courses and certification programs.\n\n### What is the length limit for the TiDB user name?\n\n32 characters at most.\n\n### What are the limits on the number of columns and row size in TiDB?\n\n- The maximum number of columns in TiDB defaults to 1017. You can adjust the number up to 4096.\n- The maximum size of a single row defaults to 6 MB. You can increase the number up to 120 MB.\n\nFor more information, see [TiDB Limitations](/tidb-limitations.md).\n\n### Does TiDB support XA?\n\nNo. The JDBC driver of TiDB is MySQL Connector/J. When using Atomikos, set the data source to `type=\"com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource\"`. TiDB does not support the connection with MySQL JDBC XADataSource. MySQL JDBC XADataSource only works for MySQL (for example, using DML to modify the `redo` log).\n\nAfter you configure the two data sources of Atomikos, set the JDBC drives to XA. When Atomikos operates TM and RM (DB), Atomikos sends the command including XA to the JDBC layer. Taking MySQL for an example, when XA is enabled in the JDBC layer, JDBC will send a series of XA logic operations to InnoDB, including using DML to change the `redo` log. This is the operation of the two-phase commit. The current TiDB version does not support the upper application layer JTA/XA and does not parse XA operations sent by Atomikos.\n\nAs a standalone database, MySQL can only implement across-database transactions using XA; while TiDB supports distributed transactions using Google Percolator transaction model and its performance stability is higher than XA, so TiDB does not support JTA/XA and there is no need for TiDB to support XA.","mimetype":"text/plain","start_char_idx":0,"end_char_idx":6130,"text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}","class_name":"TextNode"},"score":0.6948627885382793,"class_name":"NodeWithScore"}]}}

a:{"toolCallId":"9","result":{"tidb_differences_explanation":"TiDB is a modern distributed SQL database that offers several key differences from traditional databases, particularly in terms of architecture, scalability, and functionality.\n\n1. **Distributed Architecture**: Unlike traditional standalone databases, TiDB is designed with a distributed architecture that separates computing from storage. This design allows for flexible and elastic scalability, enabling users to scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed. This separation is crucial for handling large-scale data and high concurrency scenarios efficiently. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n2. **Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP)**: TiDB supports HTAP workloads, which means it can handle both Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) within the same system. This is achieved through its use of two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real-time, ensuring consistent data between the two and allowing for efficient analytical processing without impacting transactional performance. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n3. **MySQL Compatibility**: TiDB is highly compatible with MySQL, supporting the majority of MySQL syntax and protocol. This compatibility allows for easy migration of applications from MySQL to TiDB without significant code changes. However, TiDB is not based on MySQL; it is a new open-source database developed by PingCAP. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\n4. **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: TiDB ensures high availability and strong consistency through its use of multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol. Data is stored in multiple replicas, and a transaction is only committed when data has been successfully written into the majority of these replicas. This setup guarantees data consistency and availability even if some replicas fail. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n5. **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on cloud platforms. It supports elastic scaling to meet changing workload requirements and can be deployed across multiple cloud availability zones to ensure high availability. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n6. **Support for Distributed Transactions**: TiDB supports distributed transactions across its cluster, inspired by Google's Percolator model. This model uses a two-phase commit protocol with optimizations to handle transactions efficiently across distributed nodes. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\nThese features make TiDB a powerful choice for applications requiring high availability, strong consistency, and the ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency, setting it apart from traditional database systems."}}

a:{"toolCallId":"10","result":{"final_answer":"TiDB is an open-source distributed SQL database designed to support Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is compatible with MySQL, offering horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability, making it suitable for various use cases that require these features with large-scale data.\n\n### Purpose and Architecture\n\nTiDB's primary goal is to provide a comprehensive database solution that encompasses Online Transactional Processing (OLTP), Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), and HTAP services. Its architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. This design enables users to scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed, without disrupting application operations. TiDB ensures financial-grade high availability by storing data in multiple replicas and using the Multi-Raft protocol to manage transaction logs, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability even if some replicas fail. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Horizontal Scalability**: TiDB's architecture allows for seamless horizontal scaling, which is particularly beneficial for applications experiencing rapid growth in data volume or user demand.\n\n2. **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: By storing data in multiple replicas and using the Multi-Raft protocol, TiDB ensures that a transaction is only committed when data is successfully written into the majority of replicas, providing strong consistency and availability.\n\n3. **Real-time HTAP Capabilities**: TiDB integrates two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real time, allowing TiDB to handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis efficiently.\n\n4. **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, offering flexible scalability, reliability, and security. It supports elastic scaling and ensures data availability across different cloud zones. TiDB Operator facilitates management on Kubernetes, simplifying deployment on any cloud platform that supports Kubernetes.\n\n5. **MySQL Compatibility**: TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol and ecosystem, allowing for seamless migration of applications with minimal code changes. It supports most MySQL features and provides data migration tools to facilitate easy data transfer into TiDB.\n\n6. **Financial-Grade Reliability**: TiDB is ideal for scenarios requiring high data consistency, reliability, and disaster tolerance, such as in the financial industry.\n\n7. **Support for Massive Data and High Concurrency**: TiDB's architecture supports massive data volumes and high concurrency, making it a cost-effective solution for applications that outgrow traditional standalone databases.\n\n### Differences from Traditional Databases\n\nTiDB differs from traditional databases in several key ways:\n\n- **Distributed Architecture**: Unlike traditional standalone databases, TiDB's distributed architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for flexible and elastic scalability. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **HTAP Support**: TiDB supports HTAP workloads, handling both OLTP and OLAP within the same system through its use of TiKV and TiFlash storage engines. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **MySQL Compatibility**: While highly compatible with MySQL, TiDB is a new open-source database developed by PingCAP, not based on MySQL. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\n- **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to ensure data consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on cloud platforms. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **Support for Distributed Transactions**: TiDB supports distributed transactions across its cluster, inspired by Google's Percolator model, using a two-phase commit protocol with optimizations. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\nThese features and architectural differences make TiDB a powerful choice for applications requiring high availability, strong consistency, and the ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency, setting it apart from traditional database systems."}}

It is compatible with MySQL, offering horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability, making it suitable for various use cases that require these features with large-scale data.\n\n### Purpose and Architecture\n\nTiDB's primary goal is to provide a comprehensive database solution that encompasses Online Transactional Processing (OLTP), Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), and HTAP services. Its architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. This design enables users to scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed, without disrupting application operations. TiDB ensures financial-grade high availability by storing data in multiple replicas and using the Multi-Raft protocol to manage transaction logs, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability even if some replicas fail. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Horizontal Scalability**: TiDB's architecture allows for seamless horizontal scaling, which is particularly beneficial for applications experiencing rapid growth in data volume or user demand.\n\n2. **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: By storing data in multiple replicas and using the Multi-Raft protocol, TiDB ensures that a transaction is only committed when data is successfully written into the majority of replicas, providing strong consistency and availability.\n\n3. **Real-time HTAP Capabilities**: TiDB integrates two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real time, allowing TiDB to handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis efficiently.\n\n4. **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, offering flexible scalability, reliability, and security. It supports elastic scaling and ensures data availability across different cloud zones. TiDB Operator facilitates management on Kubernetes, simplifying deployment on any cloud platform that supports Kubernetes.\n\n5. **MySQL Compatibility**: TiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol and ecosystem, allowing for seamless migration of applications with minimal code changes. It supports most MySQL features and provides data migration tools to facilitate easy data transfer into TiDB.\n\n6. **Financial-Grade Reliability**: TiDB is ideal for scenarios requiring high data consistency, reliability, and disaster tolerance, such as in the financial industry.\n\n7. **Support for Massive Data and High Concurrency**: TiDB's architecture supports massive data volumes and high concurrency, making it a cost-effective solution for applications that outgrow traditional standalone databases.\n\n### Differences from Traditional Databases\n\nTiDB differs from traditional databases in several key ways:\n\n- **Distributed Architecture**: Unlike traditional standalone databases, TiDB's distributed architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for flexible and elastic scalability. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **HTAP Support**: TiDB supports HTAP workloads, handling both OLTP and OLAP within the same system through its use of TiKV and TiFlash storage engines. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **MySQL Compatibility**: While highly compatible with MySQL, TiDB is a new open-source database developed by PingCAP, not based on MySQL. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\n- **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: TiDB uses multiple replicas and the Multi-Raft protocol to ensure data consistency and availability, even if some replicas fail. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **Cloud-Native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security on cloud platforms. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\n\n- **Support for Distributed Transactions**: TiDB supports distributed transactions across its cluster, inspired by Google's Percolator model, using a two-phase commit protocol with optimizations. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq)\n\nThese features and architectural differences make TiDB a powerful choice for applications requiring high availability, strong consistency, and the ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency, setting it apart from traditional database systems.","meta":{"task_id":"cd9dfc30-f7bf-4402-97ac-1ccd6cc0a757","goal":"Provide a comprehensive explanation of what TiDB is, including its purpose, key features, and how it differs from traditional databases.","Lang":"English","Format":"text","Background":"None","Annotations":"The user is likely seeking an introduction to TiDB, possibly to understand its relevance and benefits compared to other database solutions."},"finished_at":"2025-05-12T05:26:16.878215Z","user_id":null,"post_verification_result_url":"https://verify.tidb.ai/api/v1/jobs/e6ba20fe-094d-49bb-a4d2-7d3e0d17543a"}}]
